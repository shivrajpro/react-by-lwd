1. refreshing after sign in or sign up is redirecting to '/' Home
2. auto logout should navigate sign in page
3. update post is not working as expected

fixed above bugs

know issue:
1. sign in with email: test@test.com and password: test123
2. delete the token from localStorage manually
3. refresh the page

actual: user is navigated to /posts in url but home page is loaded
expected: user should get navigated to / home page and url also should be /
